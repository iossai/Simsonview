# Simsonview
The app display the data as a text only, scrollable list of titles, and on phones,
it is toggle-able from the list to a scrollable grid of item images.
 
Clicking on an item loads a Detail view, including the itemâ€™s image, title, and description. 
 On tablets, the app shows the list and detail views on the same screen. 
 For phones, the list and detail should each be full screen. The app should have an tool-bar that displays: For Phone
The name of the app on the item list screen, and the title of the item on the detail screen For Tablets

Two versions of the app are created. Each version has a different Name, package-name, and url that it pulls data from. 
phone app displays images and info from Simson show.
tab app displays images and info from the Wire show.
